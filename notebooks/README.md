# Phydra plankton community models

Here the first models included within the library are presented in interactive Jupyter notebooks. 

The notebooks show all steps from creating the _model setup_ object to analyzing model output and provide a template for further exploration and experimentation with the provided plankton community models.

## Model applications

The following model applications are included in the Phydra library. All models are embedded in 0-dimensional physical settings.:

- A simple NP (Nutrient-Phytoplankton) model in a chemostat setting.
- A fully configured NPZD (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus) model.
- A complex size-structured NPZ model in a simplified physical setting.
